<h2>  Dear Congress,</h2>
<h3 style="font-family:courier">
 We women are more than just people who stay at home and“.. keep her house clean and wholesome and to feed her children properly”(Addams 1).We should have more responsibility outside of our house.We women are citizens and according to the 15th amendment of our constitution that everyone in the United States are allow to vote no matter on account of their  race or color. We think that it is unjust that only men are allow to vote when we are all equal.It’s like if you place two apples on the scale when on the other side there is only one .The side with the two apples will weigh down the other side of the scale. And how would you feel if only women were allowed to vote? Would you not also feel discriminated or feel that it is unjust for only one gender to vote? I know that I want to be treated as any other human being.All we women want is to have the privilege to vote and have a say in the world.And if you don’t help get what we want or denied us we all find to get that privilege. 
        Imagine yourself where all men are denied the right to vote.Where you would only stay at home to watch the kids and clean the house. I guarantee that you would do the same thing what we are doing.You would want to have the privilege that someone else has but you don’t have.
       Maybe someday in the future that women would have a big impact on the world.We will take advantage of our privileges and make the country better.That we will step up to maybe lead our country to success. </h3 style="font-family:courier">
