<h2><b>Primary Sources:</h2></b>  <h3><i>”Twenty Years at Hull  House” (book)</h3></i>
<h3 style="font-family:courier">“THAT neglected and forlorn old age is daily brought to the attention of a Settlement which undertakes to bear its share of the neighborhood burden imposed by poverty, was pathetically clear to us during our first months of residence at Hull-House. One day a boy of ten led a tottering old lady into the House, saying that she had slept for six weeks in their kitchen on a bed made up next to the stove; that she had come when her son died, although none of them had ever seen her before; but because her son had "once worked in the same shop with Pa she thought of him when she had nowhere to go."”
(Addams 154)</h3 style="font-family:courier">

<h3><i>Is relates to my synopsis because it is the reason why Jane Addams built the Hull House . So that the poor people have somewhere to go.

<h3 style="font-family:courier"><b>“FOR many generations it has been believed that woman's place is within the walls of her own home, and it is indeed impossible to imagine the time when her duty there shall be ended or to forecast any social change which shall release her from that paramount obligation.
This paper is an attempt to show that many women to-day are failing to discharge their duties to their own households properly simply because they do not perceive that as society grows more complicated it, is necessary that woman shall extend her sense of responsibility to many things outside of her own home if she would continue to preserve the home in its entirety. One could illustrate in many ways. A woman's simplest duty, one would say, is to keep her house clean and wholesome and to feed her children properly. Yet if she lives in a tenement house, as so many of my neighbors do, she cannot fulfill these simple obligations by her own efforts because she is utterly dependent upon the city administration for the conditions which render decent living possible. Her basement will not be dry, her stairways will not be fireproof, her house will not be provided with sufficient windows to give light and air, nor will it be equipped with sanitary plumbing, unless the Public Works Department sends inspectors who constantly insist that these elementary decencies be provided. Women who live in the country sweep their own dooryards and may either feed the refuse of the table to a flock of chickens or allow it innocently to decay in the open air and sunshine. “(Addams, 1)</h3 style="font-family:courier">

<h3 style="font-family:courier">“At Hull House, in the squalid slums of Chicago's West Side, Jane Addams, a priestess of understanding among neighbors and of peace among nations, kept open hours for prince and pauper alike. It was her shrine and it will remain her monument.
This pioneer settlement house, which she founded forty-six years ago, blazed the trail for a scientific approach to the relief of poverty and suffering and was the parent of much of the social legislation of the last four decades.”(New York Times 1)</h3 style="font-family:courier">

<h3 style="font-family:courier">“In 1889, she and a friend, Ellen Gates Starr, rented a run-down mansion that once had belonged to a man named Charles Hull. The house stood in one of Chicago's industrial areas. Many European immigrants who had come to the U.S. seeking a better life, lived in the neighborhood. They spoke little, if any, English and lived in crowded, dirty tenements. Most worked in nearby factories, earning barely enough money to feed their families.”(scholastic 1)</h3 style="font-family:courier">
